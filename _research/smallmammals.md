## Purpose

At the core of the intricate dynamics of ecological systems lies the complex interplay between different species of organisms, particularly small mammals and invertebrates, which can have far-reaching implications for the sustainability and resilience of ecosystems. The goal of this undergraduate research was to shed light on the nature of this interplay and provide insights into the factors that influence the dynamics of competition and interaction in various environmental conditions, particularly those of farmland and forest habitats.

## Research Overview

Working in Dr. Nicholas Gotelli's ecological lab at the University of Vermont, I investigated the competitive dynamics between small mammals and invertebrates across Vermont's abandoned agricultural landscapes. This research involved extensive fieldwork, specimen collection, and analysis of ecological patterns across diverse land use types.

### Field Methods & Data Collection

Over the course of this study, I identified and preserved over 1,200 invertebrate specimens through pinning for the Vermont Natural History Collection. This meticulous work allowed for detailed analysis of species distribution and abundance patterns across multiple field sites.

## Key Findings

The research revealed compelling evidence of competitive behavior between invertebrates and small mammals, mediated by environmental variables.

### Competitive Relationships

**Environmental Preferences:**

The data demonstrated clear habitat partitioning between the two groups:

- **Canopy cover and dead vegetation** showed positive correlations with mammal abundance, but negative effects on invertebrate abundance
- **Grass cover and herbaceous vegetation** exhibited positive correlations with invertebrate abundance, while negatively affecting mammal abundance

These opposing relationships suggest resource competition and niche differentiation between the two taxonomic groups, with each adapted to exploit different microhabitat characteristics within the same landscape.

## Implications for Land Management

### Vermont's Agricultural Renaissance

As of 2022, Vermont has made record investments to support agriculture, rural communities, and the environment through several key initiatives:

- Community Recovery and Revitalization programs
- Farmer Business Assistance Program and mentorship opportunities
- Climate Smart Farming initiatives

### Ecological Consequences of Land Revitalization

The findings of this study suggest that the ongoing utilization or revitalization of communal land, although beneficial for the community, may trigger varying ecological responses between the two competitors of invertebrates and small mammals.

As Vermont continues to invest in agricultural revitalization, understanding these competitive dynamics becomes crucial for sustainable land management practices. The differential responses of these organisms to habitat characteristics highlight the importance of maintaining diverse habitat structures to support both groups within the landscape.
