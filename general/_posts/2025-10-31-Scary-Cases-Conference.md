# Attending the 13th Annual Scary Cases Conference at BUSM

## An Unexpected Invitation

When my co-TA for Human Physiology, Sarita Som, invited me to attend the 13th Annual Scary Cases Conference hosted by the Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery at Boston University Chobanian & Avedisian School of Medicine, I didn't fully grasp what an incredible opportunity it would be. As a MAMS student still building my foundation in medical sciences, I wasn't sure what to expect from a conference focused on challenging medical-legal cases in ENT.

But Sarita's generosity in extending this invitation turned out to be one of the highlights of my time at BU so far. The conference wasn't just an academic event—it was an immersive experience in how clinicians think about risk, communication, and the real-world consequences of medical decision-making.

## What the Scary Cases Conference Actually Is

The Scary Cases Conference is an annual continuing medical education event that brings together physicians, surgeons, residents, and students to examine real-world medical malpractice cases in otolaryngology. Now in its 13th year, the conference has become a cornerstone educational program for the ENT community, offering CME credits while addressing some of the most challenging aspects of medical practice.

The conference's objectives are straightforward but critical:
- Understand legal principles of medical malpractice
- Learn strategies to minimize malpractice risk in everyday practice
- Examine real cases from both plaintiff and defense perspectives
- Develop resilience and professional judgment in complex clinical situations

What sets this conference apart is its unique "You Be The Jury" format, where real malpractice cases are presented from both plaintiff and defense perspectives. Legal professionals alongside BUSM otolaryngology faculty walk through actual cases, dissecting what went wrong, what went right, and what lessons can be drawn for future practice.

## The Experience of Being in the Room

Walking into a conference room filled with experienced otolaryngologists, surgeons, residents, and legal experts as a MAMS student was initially intimidating. These were people who had spent years—sometimes decades—honing their craft and navigating the complexities of patient care. But what struck me immediately was the atmosphere of genuine collaboration and shared learning.

The presentations weren't dry legal lectures. They were honest, sometimes uncomfortable examinations of cases where things went wrong despite the best intentions. Faculty members spoke candidly about challenges, complications, and the difficult decisions clinicians face when outcomes don't go as planned. The discussions that followed each presentation were thoughtful, respectful, and focused on one central question: How do we learn from these experiences to provide better care?

Sitting in that room, I felt privileged to witness clinicians and physicians committed to continuous improvement—not just in technical skills, but in communication, documentation, informed consent, and patient relationships. The conference wasn't about assigning blame; it was about understanding systemic issues, human factors, and how we can collectively raise the standard of care.

## Key Takeaways That Will Shape My Future Practice

Several themes emerged throughout the conference that I know will stay with me as I pursue my own path in medicine:

**1. Communication is as critical as clinical skill.** Many of the cases examined involved breakdowns in communication—between physicians and patients, between consulting specialists, or in documentation. Technical competence alone isn't enough if you can't effectively communicate risks, expectations, and next steps.

**2. Documentation matters.** In medical-legal cases, what's written in the chart often becomes the definitive record of what happened. Thorough, clear, contemporaneous documentation isn't just bureaucratic box-checking—it's a fundamental part of patient care and professional protection.

**3. Managing complications is part of practicing medicine.** Even the best clinicians encounter complications. What separates good physicians from great ones is how they respond: transparency with patients, appropriate follow-up, seeking consultation when needed, and learning from adverse outcomes.

**4. Informed consent is a process, not a form.** True informed consent means ensuring patients understand not just what will happen, but what could happen—and making sure those conversations are documented and ongoing, not just a signature on admission paperwork.

**5. Resilience is essential.** The emotional toll of adverse outcomes and medical-legal cases is real. The conference included discussions on practicing resilience, recognizing burnout, and supporting each other through difficult times.

## Being Part of Something Bigger

One of the most meaningful aspects of the conference was simply being there alongside fellow MAMS students and current BUSM PA students who share a commitment to learning and growth. Sarita made sure our group felt included and encouraged us to engage with the material and ask questions.

Being in that room with clinicians who are actively working to improve patient care, quality, and safety was inspiring. These weren't physicians resting on their credentials or going through the motions. They were professionals who recognized that medicine is constantly evolving, that mistakes happen, and that our obligation is to learn from them and do better.

As someone preparing to enter the medical field, witnessing this level of professional introspection and commitment to excellence reinforced why I chose this path. Medicine isn't just about diagnosing and treating—it's about continuously refining our judgment, communication, and approach to care.

## Gratitude and Looking Forward

I'm incredibly grateful to Sarita for inviting me to this conference. It's not often that MAMS students get to participate in specialized clinical conferences like this, and the experience gave me insights that will shape how I think about patient care, risk management, and professionalism for years to come.

The Scary Cases Conference reminded me that being a good physician isn't just about medical knowledge—it's about humility, continuous learning, clear communication, and a genuine commitment to putting patients first, even when outcomes are difficult.

For anyone interested in medicine, law, or the intersection of the two, I highly recommend seeking out conferences like this. They offer a perspective you simply can't get from textbooks or lectures—a real-world view of the challenges clinicians face and the standards we should all strive to meet.
