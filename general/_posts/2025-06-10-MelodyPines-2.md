# Returning to Melody Pines Day Camp for Summer 2024

## Why I'm Coming Back
When I finished my first summer at Melody Pines Day Camp last year, I knew I had to come back. There's something special about a place that's been family-owned since 1951, where generations of kids have built forts, explored the woods, and made lifelong friends. As the camp nurse, I get to be part of that tradition—keeping everyone safe and healthy so they can focus on having the best summer ever.

Melody Pines serves kids ages 5-13, and every single day is spent outside doing something different. One minute I'm putting a band-aid on a skinned knee from fort building, the next I'm checking in on a camper with asthma before swim lessons, and then I'm teaching a group about staying hydrated on hot summer days. It's never boring, and that's exactly why I love it.

## What Being Camp Nurse Actually Looks Like

Being a camp nurse is nothing like working in a hospital or clinic. Sure, I still administer medications and provide first aid, but I'm doing it in an environment where kids are playing games, swimming in the lake, and running around with their friends all day. It's healthcare with a side of sunshine and adventure.

On any given day, I might:
- Hand out morning medications while kids chat about what activities they're excited for
- Treat the inevitable bumps, scrapes, and bug bites that come with outdoor play
- Check in with campers who have allergies or asthma to make sure they're feeling good
- Cool down an overheated camper with water and some time in the shade
- Call parents to update them about how their child is doing
- Teach kids about sunscreen, tick checks, and why hydration matters

The best part? Getting to know the campers. By week two, I know who's likely to forget their inhaler, who gets anxious before swim time, and who always shows up at the health center just to say hi.

## Last Summer's Lessons

A camper favorite was my imaginary "Ice Emporium" under the alibi Joe Snow, which was my way of ensuring campers stayed hydrated during heat waves.

My first summer at Melody Pines taught me so much about working with kids in a non-clinical setting. I learned that sometimes a camper just needs someone to listen for a few minutes, that homesickness often shows up as a stomachache, and that a colorful band-aid has almost magical healing powers for minor injuries.

I also learned to think on my feet. When you're the only medical person at camp, you have to be confident in your assessments and trust your judgment. There's no doctor down the hall to consult, so I've become really good at deciding what needs immediate attention and what can be managed with basic first aid and a little TLC.

## What I'm Excited About This Year
Coming back for year two means I already know the ropes, which gives me the chance to do even more. This summer, I want to:

1. Start some fun health education sessions—maybe teach the older kids basic first aid or talk about nutrition in a way that doesn't feel like a lecture
2. Build even stronger relationships with the campers so they feel comfortable coming to me with any concern
3. Work with the camp directors to refine our emergency procedures
4. Help train new staff members on health and safety protocols
5. Document what works well so we can keep improving year after year

Most importantly, I want to make sure every kid has a safe, healthy summer where they can just be a kid—running around outside, making friends, and creating memories that'll last long after summer ends.

## A Thank You

I'm incredibly grateful to the Connor family and the entire Melody Pines staff for welcoming me back for another summer. Working at a camp that's been running for over 70 years means being part of something bigger than yourself. I can't wait to see familiar faces from last year and meet all the new campers who'll be joining us this summer.

Here's to another season of adventure, laughter, scraped knees, and endless summer fun!
