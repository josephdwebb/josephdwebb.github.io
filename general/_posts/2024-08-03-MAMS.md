Through comprehensive advising throughout the medical school application process, MAMS provides the academic foundation and support necessary for aspiring physicians to achieve their goals.

## Program Structure

The MAMS curriculum consists of 32 graduate credit hours completed over four semesters. The program can be finished in either one year by enrolling in Fall, Spring, and both Summer semesters, or stretched across two years for students seeking additional research experience.

**Core Medical School-Level Courses Include:**

|      **Course**     |                              **Focus**                            |
|:-------------------:|:-----------------------------------------------------------------:|
| Biochemistry and Cell Biology (BI 751) | Molecular foundations of cellular function | 
| Medical Physiology (PH 730/731) | Systems physiology and pathophysiology |
| Medical Immunology (PA 510) | Immune system function and disease |
| Graduate Electives | Specialized topics in biomedical research |
| [Thesis Research](#definitions) (up to 8 credits) | Original laboratory or literature-based project |
