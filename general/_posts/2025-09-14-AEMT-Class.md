# Pursuing My AEMT Certification at FireMed

## Taking the Next Step in EMS
After working as an EMT, I knew I wanted to expand my skills and take on more responsibility in emergency medical care. That's what led me to enroll in the Advanced Emergency Medical Technician program at FireMed in Manchester, NH. FireMed prioritizes hands-on, in-person training with real-world scenarios , which is exactly the kind of learning environment I was looking for.

The AEMT level allows providers to perform basic and limited advanced emergency medical care, functioning as a link from the scene to the emergency healthcare system . What that means in practice is learning skills like IV therapy, advanced airway management, and medication administration—procedures that go beyond what I could do as a basic EMT.

## What AEMT Training Actually Looks Like
The course has been intense in the best possible way. AEMT programs typically include 200-400 hours of combined classroom, clinical, and field training , and every hour counts. We're not just sitting in a classroom memorizing protocols—we're practicing skills over and over until they become second nature.

Some of what we're covering includes:
- Starting IVs and administering fluids and medications
- Advanced airway management techniques
- Interpreting cardiac rhythms and using ECGs
- Trauma assessment and management
- Medical emergencies and pharmacology

The coolest part? We get to practice these skills on each other (with supervision, of course) and in realistic scenarios that simulate actual emergency calls. There's something about having to think on your feet during a simulated cardiac arrest that really tests whether you actually know your stuff.

## The Clinical Experience
FireMed's AEMT program requires 10 team leads—meaning leading calls from start to finish under the supervision of an approved preceptor . This clinical requirement is where the rubber meets the road. It's one thing to practice skills in a controlled classroom environment; it's another thing entirely to perform them on a real patient during an actual emergency.

Each team lead means I'm responsible for patient assessment, decision-making, treatment, and documentation from the moment we arrive on scene until we transfer care at the hospital. It's challenging, occasionally nerve-wracking, and incredibly valuable experience.

## Why FireMed?
FireMed delivers expert training with dedicated instructors who focus on real-world scenarios to prepare students for any challenge . The instructors aren't just reading from a textbook—they're experienced EMS professionals who've been in the field and know what actually matters when you're on a call at 2 AM.

The Manchester location on South Willow Street has been convenient, and the class size allows for plenty of hands-on practice and individual attention. Plus, there's something motivating about being surrounded by other people who are just as committed to becoming better providers.

## What's Next
After completing the course, I'll be eligible to take both the cognitive and psychomotor exams through the National Registry of Emergency Medical Technicians (NREMT). The cognitive exam tests knowledge across everything from pharmacology to trauma management, while the psychomotor exam evaluates hands-on skills like patient assessment, IV administration, and airway management.

The goal is to pass both exams and earn my AEMT certification, which will allow me to work at a higher level of care and handle more complex emergency situations. It's a stepping stone toward eventually pursuing paramedic certification, but for now, I'm focused on mastering these advanced skills and becoming the best AEMT I can be.

## Final Thoughts
Pursuing AEMT certification has been one of the most rewarding endeavors I have pursued. Every class, every skill session, every clinical shift teaches me something new about emergency medicine and about my own capabilities. There's still work ahead—more practice, more studying, and eventually those national exams—but I'm grateful for the training FireMed is providing and excited about what comes next.

If you're an EMT thinking about advancing your skills, I can't recommend it enough. The learning curve is steep, but so is the growth.
